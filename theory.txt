Task 0.- 

The rules hidden in the sequence are the following:

i => 1 --> Number X * 2
i => 2 --> (Result of i = 1) / 2
i => (i+1) % 4 = 0 --> (Result of i-1) + 8 * ((i+1) / 4)
i => $i % 4 = 0 or ($i+2) % 4 = 0 --> (Result of i-1) - 6
i => ($i-1) % 4 = 0 --> (Result of i-1) - 4

So, the number for i=14 for Number X = 14 the result is 14.


Task 4.-

Theoretically my creation script, creates already an index key on the user_id that avoids a high performace in the database.
So, there wasn't any problem respect to that. Also the "count" function runs only over the "number" column, that makes the search
faster.

Task 5.-

The unique problem would be the limit in the type of the field in the database. And maybe the calculation time, but
it would have to be with a really huge number, bigger than "int" type.
